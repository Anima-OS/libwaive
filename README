Overview
========

libwaive is a tiny library that provides waive(), a function that allows a
process to waive its right to perform certain actions (e.g. open a file).

It is inspired by Theo de Raadt's tame() system call
(http://article.gmane.org/gmane.os.openbsd.tech/43085) and uses libseccomp
(https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp).
